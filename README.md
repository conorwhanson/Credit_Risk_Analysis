# Credit Risk Analysis with Machine Learning

#### Purpose & Overview
The purpose of this project was to utilize a number of different machine learning models to predict credit risk. The loan data was loaded in and cleaned, encoded, and split into training and testing sets. Next, each model was run with testing and training sets. Finally, the output of each model was run through a confusion matrix and classification report to weigh the effectiveness of each model at predicting credit risk.
